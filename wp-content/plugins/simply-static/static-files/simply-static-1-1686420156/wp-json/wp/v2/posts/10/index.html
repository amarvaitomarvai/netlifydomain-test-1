I\u2019m not stressed. I feel really good.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI didn\u2019t expect to score this many goals but, again, I could have scored more. I\u2019ve been missing a lot of chances, so I could have scored more. That\u2019s the truth.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>City were already the dominant domestic force in English football before Haaland\u2019s arrival from Borussia Dortmund last year.<\/p>\n<p>However, the English champions are still to conquer Europe and his signing was seen as the final piece in the jigsaw to deliver Champions League glory.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cOf course I feel pressure. I would lie if I said I didn\u2019t,\u201d the 22-year-old said.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cYou say it yourself and it\u2019s true \u2013 they won the Premier League without me, they won every trophy without me.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cSo I\u2019m here to try to do a thing that the club has never done before and I\u2019ll do my best.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>City are huge favourites to get the better of the Italian giants in Istanbul and become just the second side to do the treble of Premier League, FA Cup and Champions League in the same season.<\/p>\n<p>Pep Guardiola\u2019s men became the first team to win the English domestic treble of Premier League, FA Cup and League Cup four years ago.<\/p>\n<p>And Haaland believes it is little surprise that City are on the cusp of emulating the achievement of Manchester United, who won the treble in 1998\/99.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cIf you\u2019d said this scenario before the season I wouldn\u2019t think of it, of course,\u201d said the Norwegian.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cBut, again, when you look at the team, how close they\u2019ve been with every single trophy every single season it\u2019s not like it\u2019s been not possible.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWe have been believing in ourselves ever since I came here.
